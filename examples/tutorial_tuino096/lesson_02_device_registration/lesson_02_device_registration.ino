     * the credentials get overwritten together with an old sketch if you upload the device
     * with another sketch.

     * As a workaround we provide the following function to set the credentials by hand.

     * 1. run the device with this sketch once.

     * 3. Copy the new credentials from the console log
     * 4. Paste the credentials into this function in ALL sketches, you are working on and
     *    where the device shall use this "personality".
